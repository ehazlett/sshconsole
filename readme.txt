SSHConsole is a multi-session, tabbed SSH client.

It is written in C# and is licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0

It uses TerminalControl (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/IP/terminalcontrol.aspx)
TerminalControl has no explicit license but is built using Granados (http://granados.sourceforge.net/) which is under the Apache Software License and AckTerm (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ackterm/) which is under the GPL.

Credits to the TerminalControl project -- without it, this would have been much harder... :)
